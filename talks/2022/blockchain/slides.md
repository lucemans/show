So commits are built up out of the folllowing, we took svemat's commit to the side here.

For starters we have the author field, who wrote this commit, svemat.
Then we have the hash field, this is that compound thing
Then we have the previous hash field, this is for a reference back to the commit that came before us, so we always know where we are in the timeline.
And last but not least the message field.

So just so i have said it again, the hash is a composite of the content, message, author, AND PREVIOUS HASH

Its kind of like the CI/CD pipelines you are probably familiar with,
where -click- this, is just a script that does all the fun balance checking math from a second ago.

And if this pipeline fails, aka we cant afford it, the PR just never gets merged, and the transaction never goes to master

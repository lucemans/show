<!--
Web 1.0 started off fairly simple,

The goal was to transfer documents

Bob wanted to send things to alice, and vice versa

The http spec was first introduced, and bob and alice had a great time

Until they kinda both got annoyed at the incongruency between their posts and they decided to use html to have a uniform way to share documents.

Oh and it came with nice "hyper" "links" aswell, if you get what I am saying.

after some time css, and JS joined the picture, and people started using this document sharing things for things it wasnt intended to do.

Web 2.0: The central focus was around two things,

firstly user-generated content,

Your uncle bob could now, "send you a message" over the world-wide-web :omg:

And secondary, an api-driven world, a world where, everything would talk to everything.

Your bank, could talk to your mom, who could talk to your smart home, which could talk to your bank, etc etc, you get the drill.

This internet highway would be like the female brain, everything is connected to everything -bzz-.

That is a reference to the tale of two brains, if you have seen that, good watch, would recommend.

And then later we realized that letting ur neighbor karne talk to other neighbor karens might nave not been the best idea. But oh well.

so, no servers

And the people get control over the data

Yes, data is public usually public, but thats better then on some companies computer with who knows what other data they might have collected because you once up on a time clicked the close on the cookie banner.

We are all guilty of it, be real, who of you has read every license agreement of every company they have ever dealt with, directly or indirectly.

Noone, exactly.

The whole idea of the backend.... Are being replaced by smart-contracts, that run on miners, and are open source.

I could do a whole talk on smart contracts, but thats for later.

The database, that was previously on a server in a datacenter somewhere behind lock and key, is now the public (write-only) blockchain, and data is stored in messages attached to 0-value transactions. (explaination for another time, but yeah)

CDN's or "Edge Servers" like ..., gets superseded by the IPFS, a system that stores data on every computer involved.

And for the frontend, with our beloved react, vue, angular, svelte, etc.

Haha, you thought I was getting rid of angular didnt you? Nah, the frontend stays mostly the same, the way we interface with our api's is just slightly different.

Yes, I do realize I am literally wrapping an already existant hook. But trust me, you will most likely want to add logic to it later to suit your needs, so its not a bad idea to make our own wrapper hook for it.

## USE HOOK

export const App = () => {

    if (active) {
        return <HomePage />
    } else {
        return <Login />
    }
};
```

<!--
Setup our basic app component

Active, from useAuth, and then if active, show the homepage, otherwise show the login page.

# NEXT STEPS

<!--
But that was it!

From here obviously the api exposes a ton of other things, like signing custom messages, for verifying transactions, etc.
But this is it, all you need to get login working.

The frontend has now verified who the user is which means we can load their data in.

If the user ever attempts to do any authorized actions, we can tell them to just "sign off on it", and we can get a backend to verify (or on the blockchain), but, it works.

No, not really

A world where, eventhough the backend may still exist, some technologies will have migrated, and some will take standalone use, of all the awesome features web 3 has to offer
